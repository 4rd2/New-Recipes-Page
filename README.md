### What I learned

I learned more about ordered and unordered lists and about tables such as styling and configuring them.

```html
    <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">2-3 large eggs</span></li>

    <ol>
        <li class="space">
          <span>Beat the eggs</span>

    <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Calories</td>
```

```css

ul {
    color: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
    padding-left: 20px;
    line-height: 200%;
    list-style-type: square;

}
```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](W3schools) - Helped me remember and directly learn about ordered, unordered lists, and tables.
- [Example resource 2](Web.dev) - Good way of learning html and css generally.
